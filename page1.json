Provide a weekly plan with dates and deliverables. Leave time for getting familiar with the platform â€” ideally before, or in the community bonding period â€” and for documentation. If you plan to work on a language pair, make yourself familiar with testvoc and other quality controls, and factor those in. If you know of any breaks or absences beforehand, mention them and plan around them.\n- Get in contact ASAP!: We get lots of proposals: only a few are good. Contact your potential mentor as soon as possible: send your proposal to the mailing list, hang out on IRC, ask for feedback, and refine your application based on feedback. If you are remembered, you are more likely to be picked.\n- Read the Ideas Page!

It is simultaneously capable of strictly unbiased rendering when total accuracy matters, and biased rendering when artistic freedom and shorter rendering time are paramount.\n\n# Features\n\nappleseed supports fully programmable shading via [Sony Pictures Imageworks' Open Shading Language](https://github.com/imageworks/OpenShadingLanguage) (OSL), RGB/spectral/mixed rendering, fast and robust transformation and deformation motion blur, state-of-the-art ray traced subsurface scattering, exhaustive Python and C++ APIs and many other production-oriented features.\n\n# Ecosystem\n\nAlong with the core renderer, the team is actively developing high quality integrations into Autodesk Maya and Autodesk 3ds Max. appleseed is also the default rendering engine of [Image Engineâ€™s Gaffer](http://www.gafferhq.org/).\n\n# Timeline\n\nappleseed was founded in May 2009 by FranÃ§ois Beaune, a former rendering engineer from the core R&D team at mental images (now NVIDIA).\n\nIn October 2011, the development of appleseed benefited from a technology sharing agreement with Jupiter Jazz Limited and received funding for one year.

It's used at Facebook, Google, Netflix, and hundreds of other [companies](http://babeljs.io/users). It's downloaded more than [6 million times a month](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-core) on npm.\n\nWhen your target browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE) don't support certain features natively, it helps you compile it down to a supported version.\n\nIn short, developers want to take advantage of the latest syntax in JavaScript before it's implemented in browsers, now. Because the version of JavaScript depends on the client's browser, we can't rely on the fact they are using an up to date browser.\n\n### Transition to Natively Support JavaScript\n\nBabel abstracts the browser away so that you can worry about writing your application rather than trying to figure out what features are supported in each one.\n\nFor example: if you support an older browser such as Internet Explorer 9, it won't have any of the features in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), so Babel will transform your code into ES5 which is supported.\n\n```js\n[1, 2, 3].map(n => n + 2); // arrow functions!\n```\n\n```js\n[1, 2, 3].map(function (a) { // compiled to a regular function expression\n  return a+2;\n});\n```\n\nEfforts like https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env means you can take advantage of the native browser support when possible.\n\nPlease read the tips below on how to get started and how to create a successful proposal!","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"MIT license (MIT)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/V6mqPfZmMH9xA8uDER5TmRin_TXl3Bj4mLBDcdHX_aTMmEK42M6Znh5h7MTDsPfyW3OAkThTHN0PY3mMSF_ByrKRt62pLQ","image_bg_color":"323330","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/babeljs","blog_url":"https://babeljs.io/blog/","application_instructions":"This is our first year applying as a mentor organization at GSoC!\n\n## Prerequisites\n- Knowledge of Git, Pull Requests and a GitHub account.\n- A good knowledge of JavaScript since Babel is written in JavaScript, as well as ES2015+.\n- A general understanding of ASTs and how compilers work\n- It's required that you have already used Babel on a project or through another tool.

This means giving users a set of tools and libraries that enables them to develop rich, native user interfaces, and deploy them to their devices, including:\n\n* Tools to enable Python to run on different devices,\n* Tools to package a Python project so it can run on those devices,\n* Libraries to access the native capabilities of devices,\n* Tools to help develop, debug, and deploy these projects.\n\n# Python native\nIf Python isn't available as a first-class option on a platform, we'll do whatever is necessary to make Python available as a development language. And when we have the opportunity to embrace Python idiom for an API or a design, we're going to do just that. \n\n# Platform native\nIt's easy to use themes to achieve cross-platform. However, it's easy to spot apps that have been built using themes - they're the ones that don't behave quite like any other app. BeeWare uses native widgets and native functionality, rather than using a theme-based approach to application development. We also distribute our tools and libraries using platform-native distribution channels, such as app stores.\n\n# More than just code\nWe're not just about software, though. We also aim to be a project with a social conscience. We aim to develop and maintain a diverse and inclusive community, and we have a Code of Conduct that is rigorously enforced.

Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.\n\nOur awarded Android app â€œPocket Codeâ€ is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in a â€œLego-likeâ€ style with blocks in just a few steps. Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special bricks for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro,...) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc.\n\nWe also work on frameworks for other OS and on making it available on browsers.

The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing. \n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as CERN-SFT group that provides common software for CERN's experiments. This year the program has expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the worldâ€™s largest and most powerful particle accelerator  http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: detector and accelerator simulation (Falcon, Geant4, GeantV, Pythia, SixTrack), data analysis (ROOT, TMVA, scikit-HEP, Go-HEP), event reconstruction (CMS Tracking), data management (transfer2go) and many others.

Chapel is implemented with portability in mind, permitting Chapel to run on multicore desktops and laptops, commodity clusters, and the cloud, in addition to the high-end supercomputers for which it was designed. Chapel's design and development are being led by Cray Inc. in collaboration with academia, computing centers, and industry. Chapel offers a unique experience for students to work on projects involving high-performance computing, parallel programming, and compiler development.\n\n# Core features\n\n**Native Parallelism**\n\nChapel supports parallelism at the language level. For instance, Chapel provides a \"coforall\" loop, which is similar to a \"for\" loop and creates a separate task per iteration of the loop body. These explicit parallelism features make it easier to reason about the parallelism in your algorithm and program.\n\n**Data and Task Locality**\n\nWhen working on a large machine, the location of some data relative to the task which uses it or other data with which it must work plays a key role in performance. Chapel provides features which allow you to control that placement, both within a data structure and outside it.\n\n**Multiresolution Philosophy**\n\nChapel is designed around a multiresolution philosophy, permitting users to initially write very abstract code and then incrementally add more detail until they are as close to the machine as their needs require.\n\n**Modern Language Features**\n\nChapel supports code reuse and rapid prototyping via object-oriented design, type inference, and features for generic programming.\n\n**Interoperability**\n\nExisting code from other languages can be integrated into Chapel programs (or vice-versa) via interoperability features.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ouhiO9cOmNc2otF9_uh-s1fRB4kbfn9-x9gjGtLmY2DccpHt3zWa1gUS17PrDZzpm0L1djadVeO9yOZ2501T2udHmY0LsF4","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/chapellanguage","blog_url":"https://www.facebook.com/ChapelLanguage","application_instructions":"Please see: http://chapel.cray.com/gsoc/apply.html","topic_tags":["programming languages","compilers","high performance computing","distributed computing","parallel computing"],"technology_tags":["chapel","python","high performance computing","c","c++"],"proposal_tags":["libraries and applications","compatibility","compiler","runtime","infrastructure","other"],"ideas_list":"http://chapel.cray.com/gsoc/ideas.html","contact_method":"chapel_info@cray.com","program_year":2017},{"id":4906659840262144,"name":"Checker Framework","slug":"checker-framework","website_url":"https://checkerframework.org/","category":"languages","contact_email":"checker-framework-dev@cs.washington.edu","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/checker-framework-gsoc","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"Preventing programming errors before they happen","precis":"We build tools for programmers, to prevent run-time errors at compile time.

It is based on the idea of\n_pluggable type-checking_.  Pluggable type-checking replaces a\nprogramming language's built-in type system with a more powerful,\nexpressive one.\n\nJava's type system prevents some bugs, such as `int count =\n\"hello\";`.  However, it does not prevent other bugs, such as null\npointer dereferences, concurrency errors, disclosure of private\ninformation, incorrect internationalization, out-of-bounds indices, and\nso forth.\n\nThe Checker Framework enables you to create a more powerful type\nsystem and use it in place of Java's.  The more powerful type system\nis not just a bug-finding tool:  it is a verification tool that gives\na guarantee that no errors (of certain types) exist in your program.\nEven though it is powerful, it is easy to use.  It follows the\nstandard typing rules that programmers already know, and it fits into\ntheir workflow.  We have created around 20 [new type\nsystems](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#introduction), and other\npeople have created [many\nmore](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#third-party-checkers).\n\nThe Checker Framework is popular:  it is successfully used on hundreds\nof projects at Google, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big\nto small.  It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft\nand the quality of their code.  The Checker Framework is the\nmotivation for Java's type annotations feature.  Talks on it have\nreceived multiple awards at conferences such as JavaOne.

This is tragic, for today we know that the ancient world â€“ from Rome to Mesopotamia to India to China â€“ consisted of deeply interconnected networks of ideas, technologies, art, and beliefs.\n\nWe have developed the Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK) because we believe it will revolutionize the study of the ancient world. It will do so by removing barriers to entry for those doing natural language processing (NLP) in Classical languages (namely, the surviving literature of the entirety of Eurasia and north Africa, from roughly 3000 B.C. to A.D. 1500). As a framework for multidisciplinary research, the CLTK will help scholars of tomorrow discover the shared origins of what were once thought disparate cultures.\n\nAs software, the CLTK is a suite of NLP tools suited to the special needs of ancient languages. We have have three goals: The most basic is to offer low-level libraries for doing NLP in particular Classical languages (e.g., Ancient Greek, Sanskrit). Developed with an extensible architecture, our code is easily hacked to support new languages. Second, the CLTK offers tools for students and scholars to do reproducible scientific research. For instance, it has versionâ€“controlled linguistic corpora and a suite of functions for stylometrics. Third, it is a framework for multidisciplinary language research. With preâ€“trained models (such as Word2Vec for vector space models, Moses for machine translation, and LDA for topic modeling), we now provide (or will soon) easyâ€“toâ€“use tools to capture the transmission and evolution of knowledge, from the earliest human societies to the dawn of the modern era.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"MIT license (MIT)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/mPW7xNGfV6zRQW74cTVBmxeKKwM0no6K1Pr9Gw-VTffk_O15Dl2_41xoExM0e_v54pRBJKE99eQ6A1XRv9DmngX8R4f9i24","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/diyclassics","blog_url":"http://cltk.org/blog","application_instructions":"See our [Project ideas page](https://github.com/cltk/cltk/wiki/Project-ideas#gsoc-projects) for a list of GSOC tasks that are suited to three months' work for a beginningâ€“toâ€“intermediate programmer or language student.

Most work will be done in the Python and JavaScript languages, of which a beginner's or intermediate knowledge is expected.\n\nIf you know a Classical language that is not yet supported well by the CLTK (e.g., Hebrew, Sanskrit, Chinese), you may follow the pattern set by the current Greek and Latin libraries. See the Projects page on the wiki for ideas of what a good application will include. See also [the CLTK docs](http://docs.cltk.org) for what we can already do for a given language.\n\nThe other family of tasks regards the CLTK's inâ€“development website, the Classical Language Archive ([in Meteor and React](https://github.com/cltk/cltk_frontend)) and API ([in Python's Flask framework](https://github.com/cltk/cltk_api_v2)).

At CloudCV, we are building tools that enables researchers to build, compare and share start-of-the-algorithms. We believe that one shouldnâ€™t have to be an AI expert to have access to cutting edge vision algorithms. Likewise, researchers shouldnâ€™t have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.  \n\nCloudCV consists of three major platforms: \n\n**Origami** is a AI-as-a-service solution that allows researchers to easily convert their deep learning models into an online service that is widely accessible to everyone without the need to setup the infrastructure, resolve the dependencies, and build a web service around the deep learning model. By lowering the barrier to entry to latest AI algorithms, we provide developers, researchers and students the ability to access any model using a simple REST API call.\n\n**Fabrik** is an online collaborative platform to build, visualize and train deep learning models by a simple drag-and-drop approach. It allow researchers to collaboratively develop and debug models using a web GUI that allows importing, editing and exporting networks from widely popular frameworks like Caffe and Keras.\n\n**EvalAI** is an evaluation server that will host AI challenges like Visual Question Answering, Image Captioning. In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to compare an algorithm solving a given task with other existing approaches. These comparisons suffer from minor differences in algorithm implementation, use of non-standard dataset splits and different evaluation metrics. By providing a central leaderboard and submission interface, we make it easier for researchers to reproduce the results mentioned in the paper and perform reliable & accurate quantitative analysis.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/kL1VyMKkoJl04xEQV0yoQOfBXCpHUZgpZrC9Ta0Cq7PD6NwoGcXCNCeCz2IVyBgkXjxy9rrN_CjdLxsUXy0JV8M4HP0nfhY","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"","blog_url":"","application_instructions":"Follow these general steps to apply to our organization.\n\n**Join the CloudCV google groups / gitter channel and introduce yourself.**    \nhttps://gitter.im/Cloud-CV    \nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cloudcv\n\nNot only do we get to know you, but you can get feedback on project ideas and get help as you start working with our codebase.

It allows users to analyse projects containing multiple languages with just one tool, using just one configuration and seeing just one user interface.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nWith coala, you create just one configuration file. It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code,  find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines.\nAll controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n## For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool.\nBesides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n## For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.\n\n## For Newcomers\n\ncoala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Affero GNU Public License","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/WbQZ28FFe1fjF8nl3n3s7WaIA47dnpDpTdFRba3Y9iW34XtHL2PQanntLbUdmADFI_rjGwb6xX6ABMqLQtthAgOJW71ZFsA","image_bg_color":"ffffff","gplus_url":"","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/coala_analyzer","blog_url":"https://blog.coala.io","application_instructions":"Please read our FAQ at http://projects.coala.io/#/faq carefully and get started with our newcomer tutorial at https://coala.io/newcomer as well as being active on https://coala.io/chat.","topic_tags":["code analysis"],"technology_tags":["python"],"proposal_tags":["vulture","rstcheck","jetbrains","coala","gitmate"],"ideas_list":"https://projects.coala.io/","contact_method":"http://coala.io/chat","program_year":2017},{"id":5710059888705536,"name":"Computational Biology @ University of Nebraska-Lincoln","slug":"computational-biology-university-of-nebraska-lincoln","website_url":"http://helikarlab.org","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"helikarlab-gsoc@googlegroups.com","mailing_list":null,"irc_channel":null,"tagline":"Development of software technologies for biomedical research and applications.","precis":"Our organization develops tools for bioinformatics and computational biology research.

It's used to make many of the websites and applications you use every day. Drupal has great standard features, like easy content authoring, reliable performance, and excellent security. But what sets it apart is its flexibility; modularity is one of its core principles. Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need. It's also a great choice for creating integrated digital frameworks. You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable. The Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU (GPL). There are no licensing fees, ever. Drupal will always be free. The Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're more than 1,000,000 passionate developers, designers, trainers, strategists, coordinators, editors, and sponsors working together. We build Drupal, provide support, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes the Drupal project forward. New members are always welcome. Drupal 8 is the biggest update in Drupal's history. Creating content is easier. Every built-in theme is responsively designed. It's available in 100 languages, and its integration tools make it a great hub for complex ecosystems.

Instead, Elm uses type inference to detect problems during compilation and give [friendly hints](/blog/compilers-as-assistants). This way problems never make it to your users. NoRedInk has 90k+ lines of Elm, and after more than a year in production, it still has not produced a single runtime exception.\n\n# Great Performance\n\nElm has its own virtual DOM implementation, designed for simplicity and speed. All values are immutable in Elm, and [the benchmarks](/blog/blazing-fast-html-round-two) show that this helps us generate particularly fast JavaScript code.\n\n# Enforced Semantic Versioning\n\nElm can detect all API changes automatically thanks to its type system. We use that information to force everything in [our package catalog](http://package.elm-lang.org) to follow [semantic versioning](https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-package/#version-rules) precisely.

With data collection efforts well underway and supported by many hundreds of volunteers at events across North America, our focus now turns to building first-rate tools to support our work.

It is a non-profit foundation with the mission to promote and assist free and open digital hardware designs and their related ecosystems. The FOSSi Foundation operates as an open, inclusive, vendor-independent community.\n\nOur goal is to promote and assist free and open digital hardware designs and their ecosystem. Such hardware designs can for example be single \"IP blocks\" or entire system-on-chip (SoC). Our vision is that there will be multiple open source chips in the next years. Our main effort is our community hub website [LibreCores.org](http://www.librecores.org).\n\nBeside single components and entire SoCs, we see open source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools as a crucial for the advance of FOSSi. We therefore encourage and support open source synthesis tools, simulators and system generators, just to mention a few.\n\nWith those activities we are steadily working on advancing FOSSi and make it the next success after Open Source Software and (tangible) Open Source Hardware.

FreeBSD provides advanced networking, impressive security features, and world class performance, and is used by some of the world's busiest web sites and most prevalent embedded networking and storage devices. From providing the foundation of the PlayStation 4 operating system, to Juniper's routers making up the backbone of the Internet, to being at the core of Apple's OSX and powering the servers Netflix use to stream terabits of video every second, chances are you are using FreeBSD right now without even realising it.\n\nThe FreeBSD Project began over 20 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work of Berkeley CSRG with a history going back to 1978. Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\n\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Perforce and Subversion servers for experimental and third party development. This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.\n\nIn addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, OpenBSM and OpenPAM.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 2-Clause \"Simplified\" or \"FreeBSD\" License (BSD-2-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/IOF3ntTux8ygtELyAg8zgG0Qh_0LgxqoFHNQiRapAGYdfLNPM3VLdZpdT2MtowkKK28PlljbJfbE6fr_2WBHMhzUX5o0eao","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freebsd","blog_url":"https://planet.FreeBSD.org/","application_instructions":"Instructions for applications including a template can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/projects/summerofcode.html \n\nStudents should have familiarity with UNIX/Linux/FreeBSD, and should have experience with installing and re-building FreeBSD should their project require this.

It quickly became and remains one of the most important reference databases in genomics, following the rapid development of the field. Its initial mission included finding all of the genes in the human genome. A year later, the mouse genome was published and we developed tools to directly compare genomes across species. Over the following decade, sequencing capacity increased exponentially (faster that Moore's Law in fact) and large surveys started examining more species and more individuals within each species. Our mission therefore expanded to store these datasets and statistics efficiently. Finally, in recent years, sequencing has been used to study the biochemical activity of the DNA molecule within the different tissues of an individual, prompting us to extend yet again our remit.\n\nAt the same time, Ensembl is an evolving software development project. Over 15 years, we moved from a central relational MySQL database with a Perl API and static web pages, to an array of storage technologies with a RESTful interface and an interactive front-end. We have dedicated portals for the large clades on the tree of life (known as Ensembl Genomes). Our annotations are produced through centuries of CPU time, coordinated by our powerful eHive analysis workflow manager.\n\nToday, we are a team of nearly 60 full time staff, housed at the European Bioinformatics Institute, and we collaborate with many external contributors around the world, in particular via our Github repositories where you can see us work day-to-day.

This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.)

The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.\n\nThe goal of Gentoo is to strive to create near-ideal tools.

CMS is a PHP based application that powers about 3.4% of the web, 9.7% of all CMS based websites, as well as many intranets. \n+ The Joomla! Platform is a PHP application framework used for building web and command line applications, and is the basis of the Joomla! CMS.   \n\nEach of these projects has hundreds of contributors, a set of working groups, and a leadership group. These are coordinated by the Production Leadership Team. This is an umbrella application for the two projects.\n\nThe Joomla! CMS and Joomla! Platform are community driven FOSS projects developed and maintained by an international community encompassing over 200 countries. Joomla! is used by millions of websites and web applications ranging from the hobbyist, professional web developer, to large enterprises, for both the World Wide Web and intranets.\n\nThe Joomla project is a community effort which strives to engage contributors from diverse backgrounds and varying interests and skills in building and supporting great software together.

It supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, data-driven programming, and data description.\n\nLua has been used in many industrial applications (e.g., Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom), with an emphasis on embedded systems (e.g., the Ginga middleware for digital TV in Brazil) and games (e.g., World of Warcraft and Angry Birds). Several versions of Lua have been released and used in real applications since its creation in 1993.\n\n## What is CÃ©u?\n[CÃ©u](http://www.ceu-lang.org/) provides \"Structured Synchronous Reactive Programming\", a safe and deterministic concurrency model with side effects. Reactive applications interact continuously with the environment and are mostly guided through input events from it.

Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines. LLVM began as a research project at the University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research. \n\nThe primary sub-projects of LLVM are:\n*  The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs. These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\").\n*  Clang is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. The Clang Static Analyzer is a clang-based tool that automatically finds bugs in your code.\n*  The LLDB project builds on libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to provide a great native debugger on top of Clang and LLVM libraries.\n*  The libc++ and libc++ ABI projects provide a standard conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++ Standard Library.\n*  The polly project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model.\n*  The lld project aims to be the built-in linker for clang/llvm. Currently, clang must invoke the system linker to produce executables.\n\nIn addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects that use components of LLVM for various tasks.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License (NCSA)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Y59P6nMhS1_qWD79cA8HEr6ZqliJz7NfgE8OCVQ_O5efghU8UjMO6wR2euj0C31PemAmLjuDEJOF6_fK-sE_if6QPX4ZTM","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"http://twitter.com/llvmorg","blog_url":"http://blog.llvm.org","application_instructions":"All the applications should submit their proposals to the corresponding subproject mailing list (e.g. llvm-dev for LLVM core projects, clang-dev for clang-related and so on).

Microkernel-based operating systems come in many different flavours, each having a distinctive set of goals, features and approaches. Some of the most often cited reasons for structuring the system as a microkernel is flexibility, security and fault tolerance. Many microkernels can take on the role of a hypervisor, too. Microkernels and their user environments are most often implemented in the C or C++ programming languages with a little bit of assembly, but other implementation languages (such as Rust) are possible, too. In fact, each component of a microkernel-based system can be implemented in a different programming language.\n\nWe are the collective body representing [Genode](http://genode.org/), [HelenOS](http://www.helenos.org/), [GNU Hurd](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/), [MINIX 3](http://www.minix3.org/) and [Redox](https://www.redox-os.org/) microkernel-based operating systems. Our cooperation dates back to 2012 when we first met at the [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2017/) conference in Brussels and organized the first track (a.k.a. a devroom) entirely dedicated to microkernels and related technologies. The [Microkernel devroom](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/track/microkernels_and_component_based_os/) has since become a de facto institutionalized feature of each FOSDEM. Now we also take part in the Google Summer of Code as a mentoring organization in order to function as an umbrella for our respective member projects.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 3-Clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License (BSD-3-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/yxhCoEwtbrCiLMpS7pVg2eqmi_DR1c_v7vKsXBgJ88yFVToDYat2g-vjWbfddqKVC9Q2mY7bxorz9Jh6Vm1RQdWZwTW3gzs7","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"We would like to invite prospective students to demonstrate their abilities and determination to work on a microkernel-based operating system during the Google Summer of Code 2017 by completing a simple task before the student application deadline on April 3rd 2017.
