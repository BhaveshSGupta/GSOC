What would modders come up with if you could create and ship a mod with a few simple commands, making it available immediately for download in-game by others, in a secure sandboxed environment?\n\n## Minimal Engine\n\nOur engine is intended to be as bare-bone as possible, even excluding such basics as inventory, health, creatures, or combat. A series of minimal modules are meant to be bundled with the game's standard distribution to offer a sort of vanilla game experience, with a focus on commonly used systems that are often fragmented and re-implemented many times over. All such modules are community owned and maintained, guaranteed to work with every release.\n\n## Extensibility\n\nAny content is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates commonly referred to as mod packs in the Minecraft world, that in turn can depend on dozens of the smaller pieces, maximizing reusability.\n\nCreating a new module is as easy as running a single gradlew command, having a community repository created on GitHub is another single request away, and fetching source for any such community module is yet another single command. Dependency resolution is supported within the engine framework both for development and for runtime usage, including auto-downloading from a running game server to connecting clients.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/jBCJsq71CPnCSkqy1OQHtbvEGXWr8RINdfm9aQbd7NMq_gI4NuQzI4NEgUVOLQPZhLVey3yZe4jVC4F50BgWj2-35GhT-3w","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/b/103835217961917018533","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/Terasology","blog_url":"http://forum.terasology.org","application_instructions":"Thank you for your interest in our organization! :-)\n\nTo apply with us please go through the below list of requirements.

These tools are used in the deployments below. \n\n**Contribute and make the world a better place!**\n* Hutan Aceh in Indonesia is home to tigers, elephants, orangutans and rhinos. EIA International and local activists protect it by documenting forest crimes with ODK. The geo-tagged forms, rich with photos, provide the evidence needed to save habitat. [Watch video](https://vimeo.com/109241884).\n* Evaluating global health programs involves collecting, organizing, cleaning, and analyzing data. Population Council, Marie Stopes Uganda, and Gobee Group use ODK to streamline the process. [Watch video](https://vimeo.com/38123850).\n* The Jane Goodall Institute uses ODK to empower local communities to better manage and monitor their forests. ODK lets these communities connect directly with the global carbon marketplace and demonstrate the concrete benefits of their efforts to protect the forest. [Watch video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=CNXv8EEs0P8). \n* The Carter Center uses ODK to get the real-time data needed to assess elections.

[Watch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-CGzo3m4PA).\n* For governments working to end polio, access to accurate and timely information makes a world of difference.

Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (http://regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (http://pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/sVDHWw3LviXkpfFg0c7JL5ScXMi45mmZhrVxqaZIiwpgKR3rkb32_KaXocjw_bnoll_ePtotlYF99VjXufs9yiBxi6QGZxjQ","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/openmrs","blog_url":"http://openmrs.org/blog/","application_instructions":"Thanks for applying to OpenMRS for GSoC 2017!

This is somewhat like an elevator pitch.\n\n**Project goals:** This section should again be short and to the point, and it might be a good idea to format it like a list. You should propose a clear list of deliverables, explaining exactly what you promise to do and what you do not plan to do.\n\n**Implementation:** This section can be longer and more detailed. You should describe what you plan to do as a solution for the problem you defined earlier.\n\n**Timeline:** With the timeline you show that you understand the problem, that you have thought hard about a solution, and that you have also broken the solution down into manageable bits. A modest, realistic and detailed timeline is much better than a timeline that promises to move mountains.\n\n**About me:** Write a few lines about you.","topic_tags":["linux distribution","web development","realtime","virtualization","conferences"],"technology_tags":["ruby on rails","javascript ","docker","linux","angular.js"],"proposal_tags":["osem","portus","jangouts","yast","other"],"ideas_list":"http://101.opensuse.org/gsoc/","contact_method":"opensuse-project@opensuse.org","program_year":2017},{"id":5694014226432000,"name":"OpenWISP","slug":"openwisp","website_url":"http://openwisp.org","category":"web","contact_email":"","mailing_list":"http://openwisp.org/support.html","irc_channel":"http://openwisp.org/support.html","tagline":"Open Source solution to build and manage wifi networks","precis":"OpenWISP is an Open Source solution to build and manage wifi networks: from public wifi services to mesh networks and more.","description":"In the summer of 2008 the [Metropolitan City of Rome](http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/) decided to start a **free of charge and public Wi-Fi network** to be spread over its 5352 SQ KM territory including Rome and 120 other cities for a total of about 4.5 million inhabitants. The main objective of the project, called **ProvinciaWiFi** (later renamed [WiFi Metropolitano](http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/index.php/wifimetropolitano-english-version)), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing **digital divide** by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens.\nFrom the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium *CASPUR* (later merged in the [CINECA](https://www.cineca.it/en) consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the *CINECA* consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites. \n\nThe methodology adopted made it possible to host public connectivity services on non-dedicated network infrastructures (e.g.: private xDSL) that for technical and legal reasons could not be used as such. \u2028This is not the sole advantage that OpenWISP gave to *WiFi Metropolitano*: embracing the resource-sharing philosophy â€“ typical of open projects â€“ anyone can contribute to the network expansion simply by hosting an access point.\n\n\u2028The software tools and the architectures, including [OpenWISP 2](https://github.com/openwisp/ansible-openwisp2) and its [NetJSON](http://netjson.org/) implementations,  are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, we hope this will allow a broader audience to benefit from this work and improve upon it.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/pNekwasncafkQ2pz4_5TwyxaZHDyy1AU6rHJ-FFGNzL0Fag6orGBoWECJmHQ_wxWkAb0GhFjdTzcysB7EBjQrSzJ1Pnogw0","image_bg_color":"333","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/openwisp","blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"Then send us an email with the following details:\n\n**1.

This is a long-term aspiration for Oppia, the tool which allows users to collaboratively create interactive tutorial experiences online.\n\n# Interactive learning\nOppia teaches content in small units called _explorations_. _Learners_ (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations are dynamic and interactive, meaning there are multiple paths through the exploration depending on the answers the learner submits (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach.\n\nA user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor; an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make.\n\n# Community-driven content creation\nThe other half of Oppia is a community of _creators_ (users who create explorations). Oppia offers tools for creating new explorations with the goal of allowing anyone to teach just about anything. Creating explorations is very much like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate easily creating targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners).

Many of the most pressing questions about global change are limited by our ability to synthesize existing data. Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn) project specifically seeks to improve this ability. Ultimately, PEcAn aims to make ecosystem modelling and data assimilation routine tools for answering scientific questions and informing policy and management.\n\n# How does PEcAn do that? #\n\nPEcAn consists of **1)** state-of-the-art ecosystem models that themselves are scaffolds for integrating multiple data sources and theory, **2)** a workflow management system to handle the numerous streams of data, and **3)** a data assimilation statistical framework in order to synthesize the data with the model. PEcAn automates analyses aimed at understanding and forecasting ecosystem responses through these models. \n\n# Transparency, repeatability, accessibility # \n\nPEcAn's scientific workflow management fully captures the informatics of where the model inputs came from, how they were processed, how sets of model runs were completed, and how the model output was post-processed and visualized for maximizing transparency and repeatability. PEcAn's intuitive web-based interface allows non-modelers or novices to use models and techniques developed by experts.\n\n# High functionality and performance #\n\nIn addition to making the PEcAn source code open source, the system is also available as a fully functional virtual application that runs on a wide range of operating systems. The system can also interact with remote high-performance computing environments, allowing model runs to be done in parallel on remote clusters.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License (NCSA)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/KDF3rnqKXhOhuNWdB_LBGhOeO8pNzjqAFKNC9oIpFGHyg5bqMgy97LylhIw9JiObu2dKctjpB4utxf_DRw32tSXmwfqVzN4","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":"","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/PEcAnProject","blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"To apply:\n\n1.

It is also a fully opensource (GPL2) project, with no single company driving it, but a whole ecosystem of smaller firms around the world.  \nIt is in active use from the largest of corporations and government agencies with very high security requirements to universities with tens of thousands of users, yet is also successfully deployed by many small nonprofit organisations and businesses.\nPlone has evolved over the years and is a mature solution, with emphasis on code quality and tests.\nYet there are also new developments; in the last years the front-end has received a complete overhaul to use more modern javascript techniques. Also, theming is cleanly implemented using just HTML/CSS and an XML ruleset.\nThe Plone community is at the heart of Plone; usually friendly, and with deep knowledge of all issues regarding Content Management.\nThe intellectual property of Plone rests with the Plone Foundation, a registered nonprofit Foundation that exists to promote and protect Plone.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/F1dq65BV6KHxh6SKL3w0So7SgLY3C79zDil16BZAO3kn9lZiasUREUWxFnm4zrJszCEKu1mvewrpCD-VpKvtdSEh6KeNiQ","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/plone","blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"If you are interested in working with the Plone community for your Summer of Code, please follow these guidelines in completing your application.\n\n## Show interest in Plone\nDownload [Plone 5](https://plone.org/download) and use it.

It understands multiple languages and can be customized to your specific needs.","description":"PMD is a static code analyzer. It finds common programming flaws, sub-optimal code and code style issues in multiple languages. For example, it can highlight unused variables, empty catch blocks or too complex code, just to name a few.\n\n# Programming Languages\n\nInitially PMD started out to be a Java-only code analyzer. But nowadays, it fully supports 7 languages: Java, JavaScript, Salesforce.com Apex, PLSQL, Apache Velocity, XML and XSL. All languages provide many rules, that you can immediately use to check your source code.\n\n# Copy-Paste-Detector\n\nAdditionally it includes CPD, the copy-paste-detector. CPD finds duplicated code in Java, C, C++, C#, Groovy, PHP, Ruby, Fortran, JavaScript, PLSQL, Apache Velocity, Scala, Objective C, Matlab, Python, Go, Swift and Salesforce.com Apex.\n\n# Usage\n\nPMD has over 50000 monthly downloads and is actively used by many open source and closed source projects. It is integrated into most common build tools like Maven, Gradle and Ant, but it can also be used from the command line. Integrations into CI systems such as Jenkins can provide comparisons between builds to see quality improvements or degradation over time based on the issues found by PMD. When integrated into the build, PMD can serve as a quality gate.\n\n# Extensibility\n\nPMD comes out of the box with many rules in the area of code design, optimizations, naming and many more. It provides a flexible infrastructure to customize the existing rules via properties and to define completely new custom rules. The rules can be organized in rulesets, which can be shared within a software project, so that every developer is using the same PMD configuration.\n\nAn innovative approach allows to define PMD rules using a single XPath expression, allowing developers to do so without having to write code or deal with PMD internals. PMD ships with a designer tool to help build and test such expressions. More complex rules can be coded in Java using a visitor pattern over the analyzed code.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 2-Clause \"Simplified\" or \"FreeBSD\" License (BSD-2-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/hi1JVJsisFi5G9NHTyRmAog7f8Psc9_ynJLyY9UWbxYI2AA7NXgTdnuJqFepVlmCLFs6sdN2stM7x0X_R7Aw2JJZSm-0ymM","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"Although PMD is a mature project there are plenty of opportunities to improve and build upon existing features.\nWe've collected already many ideas in our [Wiki](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/wiki).\n\nWe have two kinds of idea lists:\n\n* [Project Ideas [Mature]](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/wiki/Project-Ideas-%5BMature%5D) are ready to use ideas that can be tackled immediately.\n* [Project Ideas [Inception]](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/wiki/Project-Ideas-%5BInception%5D) are ideas, that need some additional effort to properly define goals.

It includes most SQL:2008 data types, including INTEGER, NUMERIC, BOOLEAN, CHAR, VARCHAR, DATE, INTERVAL, and TIMESTAMP. It also supports storage of binary large objects, including pictures, sounds, or video.

An enterprise class database, PostgreSQL boasts sophisticated features such as Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC), point in time recovery, tablespaces, asynchronous replication, nested transactions (savepoints), online/hot backups, a sophisticated query planner/optimizer, and write ahead logging for fault tolerance. It supports international character sets, multibyte character encodings, Unicode, and it is locale-aware for sorting, case-sensitivity, and formatting. It is highly scalable both in the sheer quantity of data it can manage and in the number of concurrent users it can accommodate.

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/e6UifH3TR9p8a-8sKngoEkMHw_0yJ1ssFPNN1WH-gkUOHdRwf_qU-O5UVhN3co1AZzrI7atjqYKTtl6p-z6sKq65rRanTg","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://www.r-bloggers.com/","application_instructions":"1. look for a project that needs a student on\nhttps://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2016/wiki/table-of-proposed-coding-projects\n\n2.

This means that Scala grows with you. At the root, the languageâ€™s scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts.\n\nScala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Javaâ€™s and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.\n\n# Object-Oriented\nScala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method-call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.\n\n# Functional\nEven though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.\n\n# Seamless Java Interop\nScala runs on the JVM. Java and Scala classes can be freely mixed, no matter whether they reside in different projects or in the same. They can even mutually refer to each other, the Scala compiler contains a subset of a Java compiler to make sense of such recursive dependencies.\n\n# Fun\nMaybe most important is that programming in Scala tends to be very enjoyable. No boilerplate, rapid iteration, but at the same time the safety of a strong static type system.

The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30).

Ideally, upstream component developers begin the process by supplying SPDX flies as part of their downloads. Users of those components therefore have a starting point for the SPDX files they create for their \"customers,\" and so on. If everything is working properly, the provenance of each piece of code is researched and documented only once during its journey through a supply chain, and that information is passed on in parallel with the code in the SPDX format.\n\nExecution\n\nDevelopment of SPDX is run somewhat like an open source project: Those that participate influence. Decisions tend to be made by consensus. The spec itself is writen by a technical team with input and support from business and legal teams. Although much of the the initial focus was on Linux and the project is under the auspices of the Linux Foundation, the strategy from the outset has been much broader to be applicable to anything open source. To accommodate a range of needs, SPDX can be implemented in XML or tag-value formats.\n\nThe SPDX \"IP\" is all housed on this site. Most of that is embodied in the spec itself, but we have developed a number of separate assets that complement the specification, including a standard license list, implementation guidelines and the SPDX compatible tools.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/KPUFrolOBwRoenv7m-JwoqzokPodPn_Syqb5MRd15j89NIeaKEsP2g4mO9ZHX0dyAGdo-nf-rSiCgBjFZq-77KGnVFjih48","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"Please review the requirements described in the project ideas page at http://wiki.spdx.org/view/GSOC/GSOC_ProjectIdeas.

Our work is crafted around the idea that we need to invent new ways to more efficiently use the resources that we have and use the knowledge that we gain to help guide the creation of the machines of tomorrow.  While we develop several software products, the library which is most heavily developed and core to our team is HPX. \n\nHPX (High Performance ParalleX) is a general purpose C++ runtime system for parallel and distributed applications of any scale. It strives to provide a unified programming model which transparently utilizes the available resources to achieve unprecedented levels of scalability.  This library strictly adheres to the C++11 Standard and leverages the Boost C++ Libraries which makes HPX easy to use, highly optimized, and very portable.  HPX is developed for conventional architectures including Linux-based systems, Windows, Mac, and the BlueGene/Q, as well as accelerators such as the Xeon Phi.\n\nWe envision HPX as a library which provides services to applications which makes writing efficient, maintainable, and scalable parallel and distributed codes much simpler than current popular paradigms. Currently HPX is used to develop scientific and industrial applications and in the future we hope to expand its influence to include common applications that touch our everyday lives.\n\nIf you are looking for a project which incorporates cutting edge HPC research, runtime library development, and C++ standardization check out our [ideas page](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/wiki/GSoC-2017-Project-Ideas) and contact us either though the #ste||ar channel on IRC (Freenode) or via an email at <hpx-users@stellar.cct.lsu.edu>","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Boost Software License (BSL-1.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/tmnJNkvDOEF7e1V0X-BV_NBiVDrwvSZatV7QwWroeMkZiaZF2rVjyT4qilSkaBiEyzycmkP_0aiEMcHqj29PLpBScbCUN-0","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://stellar-group.org/blog/","application_instructions":"Please see our complete instructions for proposal submission [here](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/wiki/GSoC-Submission-Template)","topic_tags":["runtime systems","c++ standardizaion","algorithms","parallel computing","high performance computing"],"technology_tags":["c++","boost","hpx","c++17 parallel stl","parallel algorithms"],"proposal_tags":["hpx","libgeodecomp","parallel algorithms","application","optimization","library"],"ideas_list":"https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/wiki/GSoC-2017-Project-Ideas","contact_method":"hpx-users@stellar.cct.lsu.edu","program_year":2017},{"id":5696674581184512,"name":"Stony Brook University, Biomedical Informatics","slug":"department-of-biomedical-informatics-stony-brook-university","website_url":"https://bmi.stonybrookmedicine.edu/","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"stonybrookbmigsoc@gmail.com","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/d/forum/stonybrookbmigsoc","irc_channel":"","tagline":"Advance biomedical knowledge through innovative data science research","precis":"Stony Brook Biomedical Informatics advances biomedical knowledge through innovative data science education and research.","description":"The Department of Biomedical Informatics at Stony Brook University has a key role in delivering innovative informatics concepts and implementations to enhance scientific investigations and healthcare delivery as well as to train next generation of biomedical informatics researchers.

Because TEAMMATES (the product) is a software for students by students, students can relate to the problem domain better. The scale of the system is big enough (~150 KLoC) without being overwhelming. \n\nProject led by faculty member [Damith C.

JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2017 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center,  Amazon Web Services, University of Texas at Austin, University of Texas at Dallas, Brigham Young University and the universities of London UK, Toronto CA, Tokyo JP, Basel CH, SÃ£o Paulo BR, and Prague CZ.\n\nJPF is designed to be extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.\n\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications.

Users of _ns-3_ can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in _ns-3_ is the high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds.  Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.\n\nProject details\n===========\n_ns-3_ has been in development since 2006 and has made 26 releases (ns-3.26 in October 2016).  _ns-3_ models are written in C++, with Python bindings and Python-based build tools.  The tool is in wide use in the field; we provide statistics about the project on our [web site](https://www.nsnam.org/overview/statistics/), but in summary, the community includes over 7000 people subscribed to our users forum, 1500 people subscribed to our developers mailing list, 200 recognized code contributors, and about 12 active maintainers.  The project's impact on the field is high:  the number of annual academic publications citing use of _ns-3_ is an imprecise count but appears to range in the several hundreds per year based on our searching of IEEE and ACM digital libraries and Google Scholar.

Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.\n\nWe do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes [Processing (Java)](http://processing.org), [p5.js (JavaScript)](http://p5js.org), and [Processing.py (Python)](http://py.processing.org/), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.\n\nThe Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or ability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skillset, but is instead a creative and exploratory process.

We are committed to working with students to ensure that they gain new knowledge and skills as well as contribute ideas and useful code to the project. \n\nWe are interested in finding long-term collaborators and growing our development team. If you're interested in doing your Google Summer of Code project on cancer genetics, statistics, data visualization, database query, or functional programing, please contact us as soon as possible. We want to help all students submit the best possible proposal.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/0jWVNEvxURDleFO50ruK1XASK42_suBkoIEd3JngucffVVEbxmFVo8pxzwQXUQS_k-7RbjdeDF7g5TMz-vHrlbOqhemmOA","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":"","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/ucscxena","blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"* Get familiar with [UCSC Xena](http://xena.ucsc.edu).\n* Get familiar with the Xena Browser [codebase](https://github.com/ucscXena/ucsc-xena-client).\n* Develop your project proposal based on one of [the ideas](https://github.com/ucscXena/ucsc-xena-client/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-Ideas).

ViSP allows to design vision-based tasks for eye-in-hand and eye-to-hand visual servoing that contains the most classical visual features that are used in practice. It involves a large set of elementary positioning tasks with respect to various visual features (points, segments, straight lines, circles, spheres, cylinders, image moments, pose...) that can be combined together, and image processing algorithms that allow tracking of visual cues (dots, segments, ellipses...) or 3D model-based tracking of known objects or template tracking.

Think about what a user or developer may need or do to benefit from it. Why does it benefit many users.\n* Goals: What is the goal of the project, a project may not always solve the problem entirely as it may take to much time. Think hard about what can be accomplished during a summer with your skill and deduct that quite a bit. If the project can't be done after this perhaps its better to opt for a smaller one or one with subgoals.\n* What does it touch in Kodi: Think about what parts of the code this may touch, Kodi is a big application and a lot of the code is spread out and very complex. If a project touches to much it may be impossible to complete.\n* Requirements: What is needed to complete the project, what code language knowledge what hardware etc.\n* Possible mentors: Place to add possible mentors (Team-Kodi will add this).","topic_tags":["media center","video player","audio","media management"],"technology_tags":["python","c++11","xml","git","drupal"],"proposal_tags":["new feature","optimization","major fix"],"ideas_list":"http://kodi.wiki/view/Google_Summer_of_Code/2017","contact_method":"contact@kodi.tv","program_year":2017},{"id":5654744694521856,"name":"Xen Project","slug":"xen-project","website_url":"http://xenproject.org/","category":"cloud","contact_email":"community.manager@xenproject.org","mailing_list":"https://xenproject.org/help/mailing-list.html","irc_channel":"https://xenproject.org/help/irc.html","tagline":"Bringing the power of virtualization everywhere","precis":"Xen Project software is extremely versatile and customizable due to its unique architecture bringing the power of virtualization everywhere.","description":"The Xen Project focuses on advancing virtualization in a number of different areas, including server virtualization, Infrastructure as a Services (IaaS), desktop virtualization, security applications, embedded and hardware appliances, and automotive/aviation.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/NV3zYYwLc4fzFTp4vheP0xpnvCOv4RPcVwMU3Tr4oVcH2eAqSDfYD270sqkG3IaZJZhrD-2H31xZ2PJYGB7SzieQtOGOZnk5","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/b/109906712194947644104/109906712194947644104/about","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/xen_org","blog_url":"http://blog.xenproject.org/","application_instructions":"Please check the following resources\n * [Eligibility](https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/2017-Summer-Internships#Eligibility_GSoC)\n * [Make a Small Contribution](https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Internships/Make_a_Small_Contribution)\n * [How to Apply](https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/2017-Summer-Internships#How_To_Apply_to_GSoC)\n * [Application Template](https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/GSoC_Student_Application_Template)","topic_tags":["virtualization","security","cloud computing","unikernels","embedded/automotive"],"technology_tags":["linux","free/netbsd","asm/c/c++","qemu","ocaml"],"proposal_tags":["hypervisor","mirage os","infrastructure & community","xapi","drivers"],"ideas_list":"https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/2017-Summer-Internships","contact_method":"community.manager@xenproject.org","program_year":2017},{"id":6327289865306112,"name":"XMPP Standards Foundation","slug":"xmpp-standards-foundation","website_url":"https://xmpp.org","category":"social_communications","contact_email":null,"mailing_list":"https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/gsoc","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"Secure messaging with open standards","precis":"The XSF is an umbrella organisation covering clients and servers using the Internet standard messaging protocol XMPP","description":"The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is an open technology for real-time communication, which powers a wide range of applications including instant messaging, presence, multi-party chat, voice and video calls, collaboration, lightweight middleware, content syndication, and generalized routing of XML data.\n\nThe XMPP Standards Foundation is responsible for most of the specifications for this protocol, and in GSoC mentors students working on a wide range of XMPP-related software including chat applications, Internet of Things, social networks, servers, clients and others.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/o3Lssk4FmOOMiMSLfNheuQzORQaoZvbxVfR03EpWWMs5OEmb8e-m6yPVw6augoWfGWiBh7WWdYn_CpPHABsMOSdge-pbTT4","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/xmpp","blog_url":"http://xmpp.org/blog.html","application_instructions":"Hi, thanks for your interest in participating in Google's Summer of Code with the XSF.\n\nYour application can be free-form, or can follow the following as headings, but please cover off the points below.

Principles of [Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) are at the core of the scientific method.\n\nMost of the scholarly communication today is done as it was a hundred years ago. The data supporting the claims in the paper can be difficult to acquire or even impossible to find, software used to produce the results is a collection of scripts rotting-away on a laptop or a USB stick, while the paper itself, after it's been published, is kept behind a publisher's paywall, and is not easily accessible to everyone. The scientific community has yet to fully appreciate the lessons taught by the FOSS movement, and Zenodo[1] was built to make Open Science a reality for everyone.\n\n# What is Zenodo?\nZenodo is an open and free digital archive, allowing all researchers from around the world to publish their papers, data and software, which then can be cited, accessed, analyzed and reproduced by anyone. Zenodo is built by the researchers and software engineers at [CERN](http://home.cern/) in collaboration with [OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/), sharing passion for Open Source and Open Science. Zenodo is both a free and public [service](https://zenodo.org), as well as Free and Open Source [Software](http://zenodo.readthedocs.io), based on [Invenio](http://invenio.readthedocs.io) - a general purpose digital library platform, and also a FOSS developed and used by CERN as well as other institutions worldwide. By contributing to Zenodo you will also contribute to Invenio, so not only will you aid Open Science, but also many other scientific institutes and academic libraries around the world!\n\n[1] The name, Zenodo, is derived from [Zenodotus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenodotus), the first librarian of the Ancient Library of Alexandria and father of the first recorded use of metadata, a landmark in library history.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/21kfnVj0eKPB6PCbQOL2IqUMLlsDAlH6NLeWuVbHKGqmOu9CLgc05JlvoSGIfEyP471hXzGuo3mc79htI-getDnwRjdLpf0","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/zenodo_org","blog_url":"","application_instructions":"Dear Student, thank you for taking the first step to make Science more Open!
